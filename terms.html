<h4>Key facts</h4>
1. Make sure your phone is on at the time of pick-up, so you can be contacted. <br/>
2. Running late? We will wait for you! Your booking includes 15 minutes of waiting time - or 60 minutes if your pick-up point is at an airport. As long as we know your flight details, we will adjust your pick-up time to factor in any delays. <br/>
3. Your confirmation email should arrive as soon as you book. Please take the time to read through and double-check all the details. <br/>
4. Make sure you leave enough time to get to your destination. Our estimated journey times do not take into account traffic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances - or your own travel requirements (e.g. how long before take-off you need to check in at an airport). <br/>
5. If your plans change, you can cancel your trip free of charge - from between 6 (six) and 24 (twenty four) hours before the scheduled pick-up time. This is dependent on the Transport Service Provider. You will be notified of the relevant cancellation policy during the booking process.<br/>
6. Please read the pick-up instructions carefully. We will send you our service provider's contact details no later than 24 hours prior to your journey. If you have any problems, just get in touch. <br/>
7. Confirm your destination with your driver before setting off.<br/>
8. Rate us - and help us deliver an even better service.<br/>

<h3>Terms and conditions </h3>
1. Contractual Relationship <br/>
1.1 These terms and conditions (the 'Terms'), together with your Booking made in accordance with the Terms, constitutes a contract for the Services between you and the Transport Service Provider which is entered into by you and by us acting as agent for and on behalf of the Transport Service Provider. We are not responsible for, and shall have no liability in respect of, any acts or omissions of the Transport Service Provider including, without limitation, any failure or delay to supply the Services or otherwise affecting the Journey which is caused by the Transport Service Provider. <br/>
1.2 These Terms shall apply to all contracts for the provision of our Services to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions. <br/>
1.3 No conduct by Next Transfer shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of any other terms. <br/>
1.4 However you choose to book, it is important to understand how and when and with whom a contract is formed. The technical steps required for a contract to be formed are as follows. When we offer the Services on the Website, we are inviting you to make an offer to purchase the Services from the Transport Service Provider. You do not make this offer until you choose to do so by clicking 'Book Now' on our 'Payment Details' page. <br/>
1.5 You will have made us, acting as agent for and on behalf of the Transport Service Provider, an offer to purchase the Services once You have clicked 'Book Now'. We will have accepted this offer, acting as agent for and on behalf of the Transport Service Provider, once we have (i) received the necessary payment and (ii) emailed your Booking confirmation to You.
<br/>1.6 We may change the Terms from time to time and you are advised to check the Website to consider any changes to the Terms that may apply to you and/or any Passenger.
<br/>1.7 Without prejudice to the provisions of clause 17, your purchase of the Services and the provision of the Services are subject to the corresponding laws of the country and/or state in which the Journey takes place.
<br/>1.8 The Terms apply to any Booking that you make on or through the Website, so you should make sure that you are aware of their contents. The Terms contain important exclusions and limitations of liability.
<br/>1.9 Your Booking on the Website is conditional on you accepting the Terms. If you do not agree with any part of them, you must not proceed with your Booking. By confirming that you wish to book the Services through the Website you indicate that you have read and understood and accept the Terms. If there is any part that you do not fully understand, or if you have a query about the Services, please contact us.
<br/>1.10 If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Please note that any contract referred to in the Terms will be with You and all correspondence will be sent to the address given by you during the booking process, even where a third party actually pays for the Services.

Such additional charge will be agreed locally with the Driver and/or Transport Service Provider and paid to us or the Driver at the Pickup Time (by such means as we or the Driver or the Transport Service Provider shall indicate).

6.7 Neither we nor the Transport Service Provider are responsible for failed Journeys if the details you have provided in the Booking are incorrect.<br/>
6.8 As the Transport Service Provider will have allocated a Vehicle and a Driver to a Booking, and the Driver will have incurred time travelling to and waiting at the Pickup Location, and travelling back from the Pickup Location, you acknowledge and accept that in the event of a failed Journey due to:<br/>
